Torrent consumers (leechers) pay these fees, which match the existing AWS S3 pricing. Torrent consumers may be businesses or individuals.

## User Experience

Since OfficeX is so convinient as a storage app, it's way easier to get people to seed files and search.
When you share torrents, you're sharing a folder on your OfficeX. other users can right click your torrent file and launch it right from their web app (no need to download torrent files).
